      # from installing Poetry every time, which can be slow. Note the use of the Poetry version
      # number in the cache key, and the "-0" suffix: this allows you to invalidate the cache

      # things like Django apps don't need this. But it's a good idea since it fully-exercises the
      # pyproject.toml and makes that if you add things like console-scripts at some point that
      # they'll be installed and working.
